This project is a Wordle-like, a popular game that encourages users with 6 attempts to guess a 5-letter word, when guessing the correct letters usually there are green highlights in the letters position, while if you guess a correct letter in the wrong position there are yellow highlights. When guessing the wrong letter, it will display red. However, this version will be based on the Japanese Show “One Piece”, it will have the user guess the names of characters. Instead of being given hints on the letters, the user would be given hints on the character's descriptive traits such as the bounty, height, role, and affiliation. !
